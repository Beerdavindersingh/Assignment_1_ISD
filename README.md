# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project
This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment
Assignment [1]: [Classes, Encapsulation and Unit Test Planning]

Assignment [2]: [Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism]      

Assignment [3]: [Design pattern, scalability, maintainability]

Assignment [4]: [In this assignment, we will create a responsive Windows application using PySide6, with a focus on event handling to ensure our application can interact dynamically with user actions.]

## Encapsulation
[use this section to explain how Encapsulation was achieved in the BankAccount class.]

## Strategy Pattern
[The Strategy Pattern helps this app calculate bank charges in different ways. It uses different rules like Overdraft, Management Fee, and Minimum Balance to work out the charges.]

## Observer Pattern
[The Observer Pattern lets BankAccount objects notify Client objects when something changes. For example, when there’s a deposit or withdrawal, all connected Clients get a message automatically.]

## Event-Driven Programming Paradigm
This app works using event-driven programming, which means it reacts when the user does something, like clicking or typing. For example, when you click "Lookup Client," it shows the client’s details and their accounts.
